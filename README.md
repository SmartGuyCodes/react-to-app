#React ToDo App

I will creating a React todo app using REST API. 

##Backend

For the back-end, we will be using the Laravel 8 RESTful APIs. For this todo app, I will be starting with user registration, user login. Then the user will be able to create the task, retrieve the task lists, update and delete the task. I will try to create a simple todo app for demonstration purposes.
